We have used machine learning algorithms and applied that to predict our
target value (in this case our target value is ozone O3. we have chosen ozone
because it is one of the factors that are considered to measure air pollution
level). We applied several machine learning algorithms and calculated the error
generated on test data and tried to minimise the error using some parameter
tuning.
