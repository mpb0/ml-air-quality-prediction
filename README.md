# ml-air-quality-prediction
As the air is getting polluted day by day it become difficult for human beings to breathe fresh air. These harmful gases are released daily by large number of factories in the atmosphere. This is making life of the human being worse day by day and also destroying our mother earth. 
We have implemented the air quality prediction model based on Machine Learning. The various Machine Learning algorithm used to test the efficiency of the model. Out of the given three algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost ), XGBoost performed the best. We have used this in our model.
